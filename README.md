# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview of Project
Pyber, ride sharing app, initially requested an analysis on all the rideshare data from January to early May 2019. The purpose of this project is to analysis and provide an illustration for the total weekly fares based on each city type. The city types consist of urban, suburban, and rural.    
## Results 
-	The ride sharing summary dataFrame is provide below:

The data above demonstrates the disparities among the three city types: rural, suburban, and urban. Urban cities gross the highest amount with the most rides and drivers. The average ride for urban cities is $24.53, $.67 average fare per driver. As we move away from the urban cities, suburban and rural cities show a decrease in rides and drivers with an increase for both fare per ride and driver. 

 
-	Multiple line chart of total fares for each city type:

The line chart visually clarifies the disparities in the three city types. Urban areas will be highly populated creating both supply and demand for ride sharing.  

## Summary
Three business recommendations:

1.	Investigate why the line chart has a spike for all three city types near the end of February. Recommend adding more drives to both suburban and rural areas to decrease the total fare amount and increase the number of fares.
 
2.	 Observed a spike in the beginning of April for the rural area. Recommend increasing the drivers for the rural area during the first part of April by transferring drivers from the suburban cities during the timeframe. 

3.	Recommend expending the timeframe range for the next analysis for better decision making based on trends and profitability.
